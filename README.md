This repo is a modification to [this one](https://github.com/adesgautam/Fedlearn) so it works with pytorch.

It Currently works with the MNIST dataset 

## Next steps 
* Adapt it to work with [this model](http://stag.csail.mit.edu/).

* Create an 'orchestrator' with a frontend to manage all the connections and processes.
